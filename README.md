# websitebaker_backup

WebsiteBaker Standard Backup admin module for all who need a simple backup module for their clients.

This version supports WebsiteBaker up to 2.8.1.

Please be patient. It can take several minutes for the tool to create your backup files before it begins the download. During that time you will only see a blank page. 

See the WebsiteBaker [Discussion Forum](http://www.websitebaker2.org/forum/index.php/topic,18902.msg128528.html#msg128528) for more information on system requirements and troubleshooting.
